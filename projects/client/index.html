	<h2>How did Nashi’s Sweets start?</h2>
	<p>I started this sweets business because baking has always been a part of my life. Ever since I was young, the kitchen is where I felt most connected to my culture. Growing up Palestinian, so many of our traditions are passed down through food, and baking became my way of holding onto those roots and sharing them with others. 
Many of the techniques and recipes I use are inspired by Palestinian sweets I grew up with that were made by my grandmother. The same recipes we use have been passed down through generations, which makes it so much more special and authentic. Baking became my way of staying connected to Palestine, honoring my roots, and carrying a piece of home with me no matter where I am.
Every recipe I make carries a piece of home and history. What began as something I did for comfort, slowly turned into a passion I wanted to share beyond my own kitchen. This business is about preserving tradition and being authentic when it comes to my recipes and creations.</p></div>
