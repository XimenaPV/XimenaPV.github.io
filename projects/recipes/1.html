	<h1>Creamy Chicken and Peanut Soup</h1>
	<p>In the Peruvian Amazon, there is a traditional soup called Inchicapi, which is a creamy soup made out of peanuts, chicken and other ingredients. My mom's side of the family is from a region in the Amazon and and this soup is part of their and our family's culture. My dad loves this soup because of the rich flavors and its thick consistency. As she was now privy to this information, my great-grandmother would prepare the soup for him wheneve she could and whenever we ate together. She once said, <q>Because I know you like it, I will make it when you come back home,</q> so I hope that she will someday. My grandmother also prepares it, but she mostly makes it for big events or when she is asked to make it. This soup reminds me of my childhood, because my great-grandparents used to take care of me after school until my parents got home, and I used to eat lunch with them. I am not a huge fan of soups, but I would eat this one all the time if my great-grandmother could prepare it again. The soup itself is rich in flavor, tastes a lot like toasted nuts, in addition to cassava and corn, with a slight bitter after taste. It is a hot, savory soup that is lumpy and thick because of the dense ingredients.</p>
	<p> If you plan on making this recipe, I would recommend the following:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Add finely chopped cilantro to garnish.</li>
	<li>Add turmeric as a colorant if you want the soup to appear more yellow.</li>
	<li>You can serve this soup with a boiled plantain or a boiled egg</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Now, this is the recipe for the soup:</p>

					<li>Once the chicken is done, add the puree to the pot and stir for 35 minutes so that it thickens and does not stick to the bottom of the pot. Make sure to taste for salt and pepper.</li>
