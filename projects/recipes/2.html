	<h1>Peruvian Goat Stew</h1>
	<p>My dad and his family are from the north coast of Peru and a traditional dish from the region is <strong>Seco de Cabrito</strong>, which is a  goat stew made with goat meat, cilantro, beans, Chicha de Jora, beans, and rice. It is commonly eaten for lunch with the family or can be served during special occasions. When we used to visit my grandmother that lives in the region,  she would usually make this meal because she knows it is my favorite. She used to tell me <q> I will prepare everything you like, especially that Seco de Cabrito.</q> I am a huge fan of stews and, in Peru, we have a big variety of stews, but as I mentioned, this is my favorite because every time I eat it, I get memories from my vacations at my grandmother's house and my aunt and cousins. Once we moved to the States, my dad prepares this recipe in a simpler way and with beef instead of goat meat, but I wanted to share the original recipe that brings back to me such good moments of my life.</p>
	<p> If you plant on making this recipe, I would recommend the following:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>If you want a richer flavor, let the meat marinate overnight.</li>
	<li>For a better traditional flavor, you can use Chicha de Jora, which is a fermented drink made from jora corn. Use beer if this is unavailable.</li>
	<li>Make sure to cook the meat slowly for better tenderness</li>
	</ul>
	<p> This is the recipe for the soup:</p>
