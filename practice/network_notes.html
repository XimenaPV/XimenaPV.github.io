	<h1>TCP/IP Intro</h1>
	<p>Today's Vocabulary Definitions: </p>
		<ul>
		<li>Protocol: Sets out basic rules on how computers send information to one another.</li>
		<li>Packet: Tiny pieces of information.</li>
		<li>Header: Where you are trying to the the information. </li>
		<li>Payload: Information the computer is trying to get somehwere. </li>
		<li>Router: Device that connects different packets to different networks. </li>
		<li>Routing Table: Rules that a router has to use to determine the best path for sending a packet. </li>
		</ul>

	<p>Problems that can occur on a packet-switched network: </p>
		<ul>
		<li>Dropped packets, even though it usually happens to 1% of the total information. </li>
		<li>Traffic is when routers get overwhelmed. </li>
		<li>Wires get cut. </li>
		<li>Hard to tell which way to send the packet. </li>
		<li>Corruption. </li>
		<li>Order. </li>
		</ul>

	<p>Protocols we came up with in class to avoid the mentioned problems: </p>
		<ul>
		<li>Packet sizes. </li>
		<li>Include IP addresses when sending information. </li>
		<li>Ask our neighboors who they are and who their neighboors are so we can figure out the web. </li>
		<li>Use a BGP. </li>
		</ul>
