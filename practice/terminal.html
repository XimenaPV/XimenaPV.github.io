		<li> Access the directory where you want to have the html.</li>
		<li> Once you are in your directory, type "vim index.html". This will take you to the text editor where you will create your webpage.</li>
		<li> Now that you are in the text editor, type the html codeby, first, press <kbd> I </kbd> for insert and be able to add text.
		<li> Then, type the following;
